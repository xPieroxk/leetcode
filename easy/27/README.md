# 27. Remove Element

## Description
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` **in-place**. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val`.

Consider the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val` be `k`. To get accepted, you need to do the following things:
1. Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the elements which are not equal to `val`.
2. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
3. Return `k`.

### Constraints
* `0 <= nums.length <= 100`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 50`
* `0 <= val <= 100`

### Example 1
**Input:** `nums = [3,2,2,3]`, `val = 3`  
**Output:** `2`, `nums = [2,2,_,_]`  
**Explanation:** Your function should return `k = 2`, with the first two elements of `nums` being 2.

### Example 2
**Input:** `nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2]`, `val = 2`  
**Output:** `5`, `nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]`  
**Explanation:** Your function should return `k = 5`, with the first five elements of `nums` containing 0, 1, 3, 0, and 4.
