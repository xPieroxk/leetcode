# Sqrt(x)

Given a non-negative integer `x`, return **the square root of `x` rounded down to the nearest integer**.  
The returned integer should be **non-negative** as well.

You **must not** use any built-in exponent function or operator.

> ⚠️ For example, do not use `pow(x, 0.5)` in C++ or `x ** 0.5` in Python.

#### Example 1:

**Input:**  
`x = 4`  
**Output:**  
`2`  
**Explanation:**  
The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.

#### Example 2:

**Input:**  
`x = 8`  
**Output:**  
`2`  
**Explanation:**  
The square root of 8 is approximately 2.82842...  
Since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.

#### Constraints:
- `0 <= x <= 2³¹ - 1`
