# 230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST

Given the `root` of a binary search tree, and an integer `k`, return *the* $k^{th}$ *smallest value (**1-indexed**) of all the values of the nodes in the tree*.

---

### Example 1:
- **Input:** `root = [3,1,4,null,2]`, `k = 1`
- **Output:** `1`

### Example 2:
- **Input:** `root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1]`, `k = 3`
- **Output:** `3`

---

### Constraints:
* The number of nodes in the tree is `n`.
* $1 \le k \le n \le 10^4$
* $0 \le \text{Node.val} \le 10^4$

---

### Follow up:
If the BST is modified often (i.e., we can do insert and delete operations) and you need to find the $k^{th}$ smallest frequently, how would you optimize?
