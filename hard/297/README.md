## 297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**Clarification:** The input/output format is the same as [how LeetCode serializes a binary tree](https://support.leetcode.com/hc/en-us/articles/32442719377939-How-to-create-test-cases-on-LeetCode#h_01J5EGREAW3NAEJ14XC07GRW1A). You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

### Example 1:

**Input:** `root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]`  
**Output:** `[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]`

### Example 2:

**Input:** `root = []`  
**Output:** `[]`

### Constraints:

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
* `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
